"""Regression: the socket server must track *real* memory traffic only.

`SocketServer.last_activity_ts` feeds the daemon's `_interrupt_check`: the sleep
/ consolidation pipeline defers whenever activity is recent (< 30s). The watchdog
probes daemon liveness with a `{"type": "status"}` control message every 7-30s
(`daemon/_watchdog.py::_probe_status_roundtrip`). When *every* inbound line —
including that probe — refreshed `last_activity_ts`, `_interrupt_check` was
perpetually True, so the cycle never completed, the daemon never hibernated, and
the wake-hook re-ran every tick (a ~200% CPU churn on any long-lived deployment).

The fix: refresh `last_activity_ts` only for dispatched JSON-RPC method calls
(recall/capture/etc.), never for control-plane messages. These tests lock that in.
