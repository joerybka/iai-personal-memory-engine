"""R5 prep regression fence — psutil MUST be declared in
pyproject.toml [project.dependencies], not just transitively reachable.

Background: CONTEXT.md D7.2-17 claimed psutil was "already a project dep"
but it was only transitive via accelerate in the [compress] extra. A
clean `pip install -e .` produced a venv WITHOUT psutil and
_cpu_watchdog_loop would `import psutil` and fail. added the
explicit declaration. This test prevents accidental removal.
