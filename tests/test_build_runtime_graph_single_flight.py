"""Regression test for the build_runtime_graph WAKE CPU-storm fix.

At daemon WAKE several background subsystems (boot preload, sigma identity
audit, foraging, hippea cascade) call retrieve.build_runtime_graph concurrently.
Before the fix, each one independently ran the full (GIL-bound) community
detection on a cache miss, so 3+ concurrent runs contended for the GIL, starved
the asyncio event loop, and the liveness watchdog SIGKILLed the daemon.

The single-flight gate must collapse a concurrent burst into ONE compute (the
leader), with the others reusing the freshly-saved cache — while never sharing a
mutable MemoryGraph object between callers.
