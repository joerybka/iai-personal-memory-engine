"""/ R3 closure — `drain_deferred_captures(store)` daemon-side.

shipped the WRITE side (`iai-mcp capture-transcript --no-spawn`
writes JSONL files to ``~/.iai-mcp/.deferred-captures/`` when the daemon
socket is unreachable). This plan ships the READ side: a drain function that
the daemon runs at startup AND on every WAKE-from-SLEEP transition, so
deferred events get ingested into the episodic tier within seconds of the
daemon coming back up.

End-to-end story this module verifies:
    user closes 3 sessions while daemon is sleeping
        → 3 Stop hooks fire `iai-mcp capture-transcript --no-spawn`
        → 3 JSONL deferral files appear under ~/.iai-mcp/.deferred-captures/
        → next MCP call socket-activates the daemon (or wake from idle)
        → drain runs → all 3 transcripts land in the brain
        → ZERO events lost; ZERO new daemons spawned

NOTE on idle-shutdown (per CONTEXT.md D7-05 inheritance): if the daemon
idle-exits cleanly while many hook deferrals accumulate, the deferred-
captures directory keeps growing until the NEXT non-hook MCP call
socket-activates the daemon. This is by design — eliminating the spawn
vector is the whole point. The drain happens whenever the daemon next runs.

Test layout:
    A: round-trip — write 3 events → drain → file deleted, store has records
    B: malformed event line — file renamed to .failed-<ts>, counts.files_failed=1
    C: forward-compat — version=99 header → file left in place + log entry
    D: missing dir — drain returns zero counts, no error
    E: empty file — drain unlinks it, counts unchanged
    F: multiple files — all 3 processed in glob-sort order, all deleted
    G: integration — daemon startup with malformed file pre-staged → daemon
       starts, malformed file is .failed-<ts>, daemon doesn't crash

Tests A–F are pure-Python unit tests of the drain function (in-process
MemoryStore, monkeypatch HOME/keyring). Test G is the integration check —
spawns a real `python -m iai_mcp.daemon` subprocess under env-isolation
(mirroring `test_doctor_apply_recovery.py:isolated_daemon_paths`) with a
malformed JSONL pre-seeded; asserts the daemon binds the socket without
crashing AND the malformed file is renamed to .failed-<ts>.
