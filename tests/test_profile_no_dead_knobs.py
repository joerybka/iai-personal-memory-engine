"""-02: assert dead knobs and orphan helpers are removed.

Closes / / / (RE-ASSERTED per CONTEXT D-08).
The four knobs were declared in profile.PROFILE_KNOBS but never read in
production scoring or response code (see CONTEXT.md §Origin audit table,
revised 2026-04-30). This phase removes them rather than inventing taxonomy
that doesn't exist (sensory channels / event-vs-time anchors / somatic-vs-
labelled tags) or promoting a passive design invariant (double_empathy)
to a runtime knob.

Two orphan helpers (_apply_verbosity_level, _apply_surface_language) read
profile fields that are NOT in the KnobSpec registry. deletes
both helpers and removes them from the dispatch tuple — they were Phase-5
legacy noise burning ~5 µs/call.

After -02:
- registry holds 11 knobs (10 AUTIST + 1 wake_depth)
- profile_set on each removed knob returns the unknown-knob error
- apply_profile dispatch tuple no longer references either orphan helper
