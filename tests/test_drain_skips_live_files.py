"""Drain skips active-writer marker files but processes finalized ones.

Contract:
- `{id}.live.jsonl` (active writer marker) is skipped.
- `{id}.live-{epoch}.jsonl` (Stop-hook rename output) is processed.
- `{id}-{epoch}.jsonl` (existing safety-net output shape) is processed.
- The skip predicate matches the exact `*.live.jsonl` suffix only.
