# Contributing to iai-mcp

Thanks for considering a contribution. This project is small and opinionated. Read this before opening a large PR.

## Scope

iai-mcp is a local memory layer for MCP-over-stdio hosts. Contributions that fit the scope:

- Bug fixes in capture, recall, consolidation, daemon lifecycle, or the MCP wrapper.
- New bench harnesses, or improvements to existing ones.
- Documentation fixes and clarifications.
- Platform support (Linux, Windows) once the abstractions are ready.
- Compatibility with additional MCP-over-stdio hosts (with evidence it was tested end to end).

Contributions outside scope (will likely be declined):

- Cloud sync, remote storage, or any network-exposed surface beyond the existing local UNIX socket.
- Major architectural rewrites without prior discussion in an issue.
- Replacing the three-tier memory model (episodic / semantic / procedural).
- Telemetry of any kind.

If you're not sure, open an issue first to discuss before writing code.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeAbra/iai-mcp.git
cd iai-mcp
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Build the TypeScript MCP wrapper:

```bash
cd mcp-wrapper
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

A handful of daemon and bridge tests are sensitive to test-pollution and may pass cleanly on a rerun. The harness retries up to twice automatically. If a test fails three times, it's a real failure.

For changes to a specific area, the relevant test files:

- Capture: `tests/test_capture_*`
- Recall: `tests/test_recall_*`
- Consolidation: `tests/test_consolidation_*`, `tests/test_sleep_*`
- Daemon lifecycle: `tests/test_daemon_*`, `tests/test_fsm_*`
- MCP wrapper: `mcp-wrapper/test/`

## Lint

```bash
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

PRs are expected to pass `ruff check` clean.

## Benchmarks

If your change touches retrieval, capture, or consolidation, include before/after numbers from the relevant bench in the PR description:

```bash
python -m bench.verbatim
python -m bench.neural_map
python -m bench.tokens
python -m bench.longmemeval_blind --split S --out /tmp/out.json
```

Don't tune to the bench. The LongMemEval-S run is blind on purpose.

## Commit style

- Imperative mood: `Fix X`, `Add Y`, not `Fixed X` or `Adding Y`.
- One logical change per commit.
- Keep messages short. One-line subject, body only when motivation is non-obvious.

## Pull requests

- Small PRs land faster than large ones.
- Reference the issue your PR addresses.
- Include test coverage for changed behaviour, or explain in the PR description why it isn't applicable.
- For retrieval / capture / consolidation changes, include bench re-runs.

The PR template will prompt for the relevant items.
