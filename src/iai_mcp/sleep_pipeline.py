"""Phase 10.3 — Sleep cycle pipeline + L3 failure grammar.

Five ordered atomic steps run only inside the SLEEP lifecycle state:
    1. SCHEMA_MINE       — extract schemas from episodic
    2. KNOB_TUNE         — recompute procedural knobs
    3. DREAM_DECAY       — Hebbian decay + edge prune
    4. OPTIMIZE_LANCE    — table-level optimize(cleanup_older_than)
    5. COMPACT_RECORDS   — final records.lance compaction

Design invariants:

* Each step is **transactional** — Lance optimize is itself transactional;
  schema_mine / knob_tune / dream_decay write their own atomic temp+swap
  semantics through the modules they delegate to. The pipeline never
  modifies `MemoryRecord.literal_surface` (verbatim-recall invariant
  carried forward from / Plan 5/6).

* On exception mid-step N, `lifecycle_state.json.sleep_cycle_progress`
  records `{last_completed_step: N-1, attempt: K, last_error: "..."}`
  via the same atomic-replace path as `lifecycle_state.save_state`.

* **3-strike → 24h auto-quarantine**: three consecutive failures of
  the SAME step (attempt ≥ 3 for that step) triggers quarantine. While
  quarantined, `run()` short-circuits with `quarantine_triggered=True`.
  Auto-recovery once `now >= until_ts`; manual recovery via
  `reset_quarantine()` or `iai-mcp maintenance sleep-cycle --reset-quarantine`.

* **Bounded deferral** (≤2 sec target via ≤10 sec checkpoint chunks):
  a callable `interrupt_check` is checked between chunks. If True, the
  current chunk completes, progress is persisted, and `run()` returns
  with `completed_steps` so far. The state machine then transitions to
  WAKE; the next SLEEP cycle resumes from the same chunk.

This module's heavy lifting **delegates to existing functions** —
schema mining (`schema.induce_schemas_tier0`), Hebbian decay
(`sleep._decay_edges`), table optimize (`maintenance.optimize_lance_storage`),
records compaction (Phase 07.14-01 `optimize_lance_storage(retention=0d)`).
The pipeline is orchestration only.

Daemon main-loop integration (Phase 10.4/10.5) and yield-gate removal
(Phase 10.6) are shipped. ``continuous_audit`` (identity_audit.py) and
``_hippea_cascade_loop`` (daemon.py) remain as background tasks
running alongside the sleep-cycle pipeline; ``dream_daemon`` was
removed in Phase 10.6.

Constitutional guards
---------------------
* C1 HUMAN-FIRST: pipeline runs only in SLEEP state, so MCP traffic
  cannot collide. The legacy ``_should_yield_to_mcp`` gate was removed
  in — SLEEP-state isolation is the sole guarantor.
* C3 ZERO paid-API cost: no reference to ANTHROPIC_API_KEY anywhere.
  Schema induction stays Tier-0 (llm_enabled=False is the only path
  this pipeline exercises).
* C5 / verbatim preservation: the pipeline does NOT touch
  `MemoryRecord.literal_surface`. Every delegated function is a
  metadata mutator (FSRS state, edge weights, schema candidates,
  Lance manifests, profile knobs).
* C6 read-only audit: schema mining is MVCC reads against records;
  decay is metadata-only on edges; optimize is Lance-internal.

        Behaviour summary:

        1. If `is_quarantined()`: return immediately with
           `quarantine_triggered=True` and `completed_steps=[]`. The
           caller is expected to surface this in CLI output / doctor row.

        2. Auto-recovery: if `quarantine` exists but `until_ts` is in
           the past, clear it (logged as `quarantine_lifted`,
           reason=`auto_recovery_after_ttl`) and proceed.

        3. Determine resume point from `_load_progress()`:
           - No progress record OR last_completed_step == 0 → start at
             SCHEMA_MINE (step 1).
           - last_completed_step == K (1 ≤ K < 5) → start at step K+1.
           - last_completed_step == 5 → fresh cycle (start at step 1);
             we treat a successful prior run that was never cleared as
             a fresh start, not a no-op.

        4. For each step from `start` to COMPACT_RECORDS:
           - Emit `sleep_step_started`.
           - Call `_step_*(interrupt_check)`. The step body itself
             checks the interrupt between chunks and persists progress.
           - On interrupt (returned False): early-return with
             `interrupted=True`. progress is already saved by the
             step body; we do NOT touch it here.
           - On exception: save progress with attempt+1, log
             `sleep_step_completed` (with error payload), check 3-strike
             → maybe quarantine, then return with `failed_step` set.
           - On success: emit `sleep_step_completed`, persist progress
             with last_completed_step=step.value (attempt reset to 0).

        5. On full success: clear progress (sleep_cycle_progress=None).

        Failure isolation: the helper functions used by step bodies
        already have their own "never-raise" disciplines where
        applicable (e.g. `optimize_lance_storage` per D7.3-09); this
        method's try/except is a defense-in-depth wrapper around the
        whole step call.
