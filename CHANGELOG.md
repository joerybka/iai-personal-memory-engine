# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Experimental Linux support.** The native engine now builds on Linux (the
  Rust extension no longer hard-depends on a macOS-only acceleration backend),
  the daemon installs as a systemd user service, and the capture/recall hooks
  run on POSIX shells. `scripts/install.sh` handles the Linux path and the
  README documents the extra build prerequisites. Validated on macOS; Linux is
  code-complete but not yet validated end-to-end — testing and port feedback
  are welcome.

### Changed

- **Source restructured into focused packages.** The largest modules — `cli`,
  `store`, `daemon`, `hippo`, `doctor`, `migrate`, and `core` — are now packages
  with concern-grouped sub-modules instead of single large files. The public API,
  the `iai-mcp` / `iai` CLI surface, the MCP tool set, and the on-disk store
  format are unchanged; this is an internal reorganization that makes the storage,
  daemon, community-detection, and migration layers easier to read and navigate.
- Background daemon and graph-cache rebuild paths gained additional
  resource-isolation and reliability hardening.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- MCP `tools/list` no longer stalls ~5 seconds when the daemon is down: the
  wrapper connects the MCP transport first and wakes the daemon in the
  background, so tool discovery answers from the static registry immediately.
- Shell scripts (`scripts/install.sh` and siblings) ship with the executable
  bit set; `./scripts/install.sh` works without a `bash` prefix.
- The wrapper test runner no longer hangs after the suite finishes (reconnect
  socket and timer are unref'd; teardown reconnects are suppressed).
- Store teardown is more deterministic: a reference cycle between the store
  and its database handle was broken.
- On machines without the optional LongMemEval dataset or a freshly built
  native extension, the affected tests now skip instead of failing.

### Added

- Session capture keeps full transcripts: the per-session turn ceiling was
  raised to 100 000 turns.
- `iai-mcp migrate --rederive-timestamps` repairs legacy records whose
  timestamps collapsed to a single import time.
- Doctor: a new check flags time-collapsed episodic sessions, and the daemon
  writes an audit event when it was respawned by the doctor.
- Typed stubs for the native extension (`iai_mcp_native.pyi`) ship in the
  wheel and the source tree.

### Changed

- launchd: the daemon installs as always-on (`RunAtLoad=true`, restart on
  crash) instead of socket-activated. The daemon starts at login and is
  immediately available to the first session.

### Removed

- The experimental summary-compression module and its optional `[compress]`
  extra. The path was a transparent passthrough fallback; removing it drops a
  ~2.3 GB optional model dependency.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Packaging: the launchd plist, systemd unit, and capture/recall hooks now ship
  inside the wheel (under `iai_mcp/_deploy/`) and are resolved via
  `importlib.resources`. `iai-mcp daemon install` and hook setup no longer fail
  on a clean `pip install`.
- Python/CLI path resolution: the MCP server config and capture hooks now use the
  running interpreter (`sys.executable`) and resolve the `iai-mcp` CLI via `PATH`,
  so installs under pyenv and non-default layouts work.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- Daemon RSS crash-loop: `find_record_by_tag` no longer materializes the full
  records table on every capture-dedup probe; it now uses a targeted SQL query.
  (Fixes high-RSS kill/respawn cycles on large stores.)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-04

First stable release. The architecture has settled and the public surface — the
MCP tool set and the on-disk store — is committed-to from here on. SemVer-major
bump from `0.4.2`.

### Added

- **Hippo storage engine** — a single encrypted local store holding records, the
  vector index, the graph, and the event ledger together, built on SQLite +
  `hnswlib` + AES-256-GCM. Replaces the previous embedded vector database.
- **Native Rust engine** (`iai_mcp_native`) — the text embedder and the graph
  kernels (centrality, clustering, connectivity) run as a compiled Rust
  extension. Built automatically during `pip install` via `setuptools-rust`;
  `iai-mcp build-native` rebuilds it in place.
- **MOSAIC community detection** — original MIT-licensed, pure-Python + Numba
  algorithm written for the memory-graph workload (small graph, heterogeneous
  edge weights, re-clustered every sleep cycle) with a calibrated quality floor,
  a hyper-fragmentation guard, and per-community lineage across consolidation.
- **Lilli HD substrate** — hyperdimensional memory representations (BSC / FHRR /
  sparse VSA) backing the episodic / semantic / procedural tiers, with
  structural recall by the shape of a memory at zero LLM cost.
- **Queryable cross-session episodic recall** — turns are captured verbatim and a
  relevant slice is surfaced at the start of each new session; recent turns are
  also queryable directly through the `iai` CLI and the `episodes_recent` tool.
- **`iai` user CLI** — `iai recall` / `capture` / `ask` / `status`, driven from
  any shell, separate from the operator-side `iai-mcp` CLI. Falls back to an
  offline scan when the daemon is down.
- **Subscription-billed consolidation** — the nightly LLM step runs through your
  existing Claude subscription via `claude -p`; no API key, capped at ≤1% of the
  daily quota.
- **Export / backup / restore CLI** — full data portability of the store, crypto
  key, and config.
- **Write-ahead log for destructive sleep operations** — consolidation and
  pruning steps are journaled and resume across a crash.
- **Typed exception hierarchy** — narrowed error handling across the daemon and
  pipeline.
- **`iai-mcp doctor`** — 23 health checks across the daemon, the store, the
  native engine, and the subscription credential path.

### Changed

- **Storage** moved from the previous embedded vector database to Hippo.
- **Embedder** is now the native Rust embedder (English-only, 384-dimensional),
  built locally — no large Python ML runtime is installed.
- **Graph algorithms** run through the native Rust engine plus a pure-numpy
  rich-club helper instead of a third-party graph library at runtime.
- **Install** is pip-native: `pip install` compiles the native engine through
  `setuptools-rust`. There is no shell install script.
- **Graph centrality** is computed unweighted.
- **Record schema** carries hyperdimensional tier fields; migration from an
  older store is idempotent.

### Removed

- The previous embedded vector database from the runtime path — it now installs
  only via the one-time `migration` extra to import a legacy store.
- The PyTorch-based embedding stack (`sentence-transformers`, `torch`) — replaced
  by the native Rust embedder.
- The third-party hyperdimensional-computing dependency — replaced by the in-tree
  Lilli HD substrate.
- The third-party graph library from the runtime path — it remains a test-only
  oracle in the `dev` extra.
- Language auto-detection — the store is English-only by design.
- `pydantic` and `structlog` — unused; replaced by the standard library.
- The API-key SDK path — the daemon never calls a paid token API; consolidation
  is subscription-only.

### Fixed

- Recall hot-path latency and daemon responsiveness under load (state I/O moved
  off the event loop).
- A range of store, migration, and consolidation stability issues surfaced while
  hardening the new storage and native-engine paths.

### Security

- All records encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM; the key is local
  (`~/.iai-mcp/.key`, mode 0600). No telemetry, no cloud dependency, and no API
  key stored or required by the daemon.

### Migration

Existing installs with data in the legacy store must import it once before the
first `1.0.0` start:

```
pip install ".[migration]"
python scripts/migrate_lance_to_hippo.py
```

The script backs up the old data before any writes and verifies byte-for-byte
before removing it.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Update-check SessionStart hook** (`iai_mcp/_deploy/hooks/iai-mcp-update-check.sh`): on new session startup, compares the installed version against the latest GitHub release. Prints one line when an update is available; silent otherwise. Result cached for 6 hours; fetch runs in a detached background subshell so session startup is never blocked.
- `capture-hooks install` now registers the update-check hook alongside capture and recall hooks. `capture-hooks uninstall` and `capture-hooks status` handle it symmetrically.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **GIL contention between REM cycles and MCP requests**: `_tick_body` now breaks the REM loop when `mcp_socket` reports active connections or recent activity (within the 30 s interrupt window). Previously, the SLEEP-state `interrupt_check` in `lifecycle_tick` covered only the new-lifecycle path; the legacy `_tick_body` REM loop could hold the GIL through consecutive cycles, blocking `memory_recall` responses.
- **`INTERRUPT_RECENT_ACTIVITY_WINDOW_SEC` promoted to module scope** so both `_tick_body` and `lifecycle_tick` reference the same constant. Previously duplicated as a local inside `main()`.

### Added

- **Session-capture hook**: `IAI_MCP_SESSION_CAPTURE_CLI` environment variable for developer-override of the CLI binary path. CLI lookup now uses a bash array instead of a backslash-continuation for-loop (mirrors the session-recall hook change in 0.4.0).
- 2 new regression tests covering the MCP-yield branch (active vs. idle socket scenarios).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Memory bank** — denormalized read-side caches under `~/.iai-mcp/.memory-bank/`. Two tiers:
  - `processed/salience-top-N.jsonl`: daemon writes the top-1000 records by graph-centrality salience once per REM-loop completion. Plaintext JSONL with base64-encoded embeddings.
  - `recent/window-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`: each drained capture is mirrored as an AES-256-GCM encrypted JSONL line. AAD is bound to the window-file's date string so a cold reader can decrypt without knowing any record id. Retention sweep (default 30 days) runs at the end of every drain pass.
- **New CLI command `iai-mcp bank-recall`** — substring fallback over the bank tiers without booting the daemon or loading the embedder. Returns a `memory_recall`-shaped JSON response so the wrapper's socket-dead fallback path is wire-compatible.
- **FSM drift detection** (`fsm_reconcile.py`): daemon startup compares the canonical `lifecycle_state.json` and legacy `.daemon-state.json`; a mismatch emits a `fsm_drift_detected` warning event. Detect-only — no auto-correction.
- **Backup archiver** (`archive_backups.py`): daemon startup moves any leftover `lifecycle_state.json.HIBERNATION-stuck*.bak` recovery artifacts into `~/.iai-mcp/archive/` with mtime-stamped names. Idempotent and fail-safe.
- **Session-recall hook**: `IAI_MCP_SESSION_RECALL_CLI` environment variable for developer-override of the CLI binary path. CLI lookup now uses a bash array instead of a backslash-continuation for-loop.
- 18 new regression tests across 5 test files covering bank writers, bank-recall CLI, retry policy, FSM reconcile, and backup archiver.

### Changed

- **Deferred-capture retry policy**: failed `.jsonl` files are now retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff (60 s, 120 s, 240 s). After the third failure the file transitions to `.permanent-failed-<ts>.jsonl` and a `permanent_capture_failure` event is emitted at severity `critical`. Terminal files are never reprocessed. Previously, failed files were renamed once and skipped forever.
- **Session-recall hook**: removed the 24-hour staleness cap on the precache file. The daemon-written cache is now served whenever it exists and reads non-empty, regardless of age. Log marker changed from `cache-hit fresh` to `cache-hit age=`.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-13

### Security

- Precache file (`~/.iai-mcp/.session-start-payload.cached.md`) now created with mode 0600 instead of process umask default (was 0644 world-readable).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Session-start precache**: the daemon writes the recall payload to a cache file (`~/.iai-mcp/.session-start-payload.cached.md`) once per REM-loop completion. The SessionStart hook reads this file when fresh (mtime < 24 h), avoiding a JSON-RPC call into core that would block on the exclusive store lock during DREAMING.
- 4 new regression tests covering the precache writer, cache-hit, cache-miss-absent, and cache-miss-stale paths.

### Changed

- `assemble_session_start` refactored into an emit-free `_compose_session_start_payload` helper plus a thin wrapper that adds the `session_started` event. Public API and return type unchanged.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Per-turn ambient capture** via a new `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`iai_mcp/_deploy/hooks/iai-mcp-turn-capture.sh`). Each prompt and the preceding assistant turn(s) are appended to a per-session `.live.jsonl` buffer as pure file IO (~5 ms, no daemon RPC, no embedder). The Stop hook atomically renames the buffer at session end; the daemon drains it through the full pipeline on the next idle edge.
- **Session-start recall injection** via a new `SessionStart` hook (`iai_mcp/_deploy/hooks/iai-mcp-session-recall.sh`). On session open the hook calls `iai-mcp session-start` and pipes the assembled memory prefix (L0 identity, L1 critical facts, L2 communities, global rich-club) to stdout, capped at 10 000 chars. Claude Code injects it as `additionalContext`. Fail-safe: empty store or unreachable daemon exits 0 with empty stdout.
- **New CLI command `iai-mcp session-start`** exposes the payload formatter for manual or debug use. Connects to the daemon socket with a 5 s connect / 30 s read timeout.
- **New CLI command `iai-mcp capture-turn-deferred`** exposes the per-turn writer for manual or debug use.
- **3-hook installer**: `iai-mcp capture-hooks install` now wires `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `SessionStart` hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`. Uninstall and status report all three.
- **Daemon DROWSY drain**: the daemon now drains the deferred-captures buffer on the `WAKE → DROWSY` lifecycle edge (5-min idle) in addition to the existing post-REM drain. Buffers no longer sit indefinitely when a quiet window doesn't fire.
- **Auto-provision `.crypto.key`**: `iai-mcp daemon install` and `scripts/install.sh` auto-generate `~/.iai-mcp/.crypto.key` on fresh installs. Idempotent; the `IAI_MCP_CRYPTO_PASSPHRASE` fallback is preserved.
- **Drain cap**: each drain pass is capped at 5 000 events. Remainder is written to `*.partial.jsonl` for the next pass.
- README: headless/VPS deployment section, AVX2 requirement, troubleshooting table.

### Changed

- **Capture hooks section** in README rewritten for the 3-hook model.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Opt-in int8 embedding quantization** via the `IAI_MCP_EMBED_QUANTIZE=int8` environment variable. The default `fp32` path is unchanged. Round-trip cosine similarity ≥ 0.99 on `bge-small-en-v1.5` in tests. New `Embedder.embed_quantized()` surface returns a `QuantizedVector` with per-vector `scale` and `zero_point` calibration.
- **Derived temporal validity**: `memory_recall` hits and anti-hits now carry `valid_from` and `valid_to` fields derived at recall time from the contradiction-edge graph. `valid_from` defaults to the record's `created_at`; `valid_to` is set only when a newer record contradicts it. Both default to `None` on paths that don't enrich (back-compat preserved).
- **MCP tool annotations and outputSchema** on every tool. Each tool now declares `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, and `title` annotations plus a structured `outputSchema`. Lifts Glama TDQS from C to B.
- **`BENCHMARKS.md`** — public methodology document covering the eight project benchmarks (M-01 token budget, M-02 latency, M-03 RSS, M-04 verbatim, M-05 trajectory, M-06 multilingual, M-07 session cost, M-08 LongMemEval-S).
- **Bench harness reliability**: `bench/longmemeval_blind.py` now supports `--resume` and `--fresh` flags, auto-cleans errored checkpoints by default, requires an explicit `IAI_MCP_STORE_PASSPHRASE` for the encrypted store, and classifies errored rows separately from genuine misses in the summary.
- **Codex CLI** as an optional `capture-hooks` target for ambient Stop-hook capture. New: `iai-mcp capture-hooks install --target codex|claude|all` and `iai-mcp capture-hooks status --target all`.
- README documents Claude Code and Codex setup paths for capture hooks and MCP wiring.

### Changed

- **Behavior — stale downweight on recall.** Records contradicted by a newer record are now downweighted (not hidden) in both `hits` and `anti_hits`. Score is multiplied by `STALE_DOWNWEIGHT_FACTOR`, and the `reason` field carries a ` · stale` suffix. Top-K ranking may shift compared to v0.1.0 — fresh lower-cosine records can outrank stale higher-cosine ones. Audit trail preserved (records are not removed).
- **API contract — deterministic `overnight_digest`.** The `overnight_digest` block in `memory_recall` responses is now deterministic: same inputs produce the same shape and field set. When no REM cycle has run, the digest is a zeroed default instead of a partial dict. Same top-level keys returned over both stdio and socket transports.
- **API contract — `camouflaging_status` outputSchema fields renamed** to match the actual Python response. `formality_trend` → `trajectory_slope`, `anomaly_score` → `current_mean`, plus new `sample_count: integer`. Permissive JSON Schema consumers were already tolerant; strict-validation consumers must update.

### Known fragile surfaces

- `IAI_MCP_EMBED_QUANTIZE` accepts only `int8` (lowercase) or unset. Any other value — including `INT8`, `int4`, or typos — causes the daemon to fail loud at startup with a `ValueError`. This is intentional; no silent fallback to `fp32`.
- New `valid_from` and `valid_to` keys in `hits[]` and `anti_hits[]` are additive (default `None`). Strict JSON Schema consumers that validate with `additionalProperties: false` will reject the response shape until they widen their schema.
- The `_knobs_applied` field is present in the `memory_recall` response but is not yet declared in the tool's `outputSchema`. Known debt; will be addressed in a follow-up release.
